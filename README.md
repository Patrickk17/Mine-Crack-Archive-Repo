# Mine-Crack-Archive-Repo
This is an archive of the Mine-Crack minecraft server and it's contents. It includes world saves, plugins, scripts, config files, and the source code for the Quoll bot.

#### Minecraft Version: 1.16.1
#### Type: Vanilla Survival, Multi-World

## [Quoll Discord Bot](https://github.com/Patrickk17/Quoll)
Used for:
- User management (banning, kicking, muting, etc)
- Copying announcements into the #minecraft channel which is fed into the Minecraft Server's chat
- Preventing in-game chat messages from being displayed in #minecraft
- Deleting whispers from the server console channel (they are still available to view in the server logs.)
- Removing spam from the #Server-Console channel.

To get this bot on your server, you must contact me.

## [Server Configuation Files](https://github.com/Patrickk17/Mine-Crack-Archive-Repo/tree/main/config-files)
Specifications for the server. Note: This directory does not include plugin config files, those can be found in the [plugins directory](https://github.com/Patrickk17/Mine-Crack-Archive-Repo/tree/main/plugins)

## [Plugins](https://github.com/Patrickk17/Mine-Crack-Archive-Repo/tree/main/plugins)
Contains a list of plugins on the Mine-Crack server, as well as links, descriptions, config files, and .jar files of the plugins.

## [Scripts](https://github.com/Patrickk17/Mine-Crack-Archive-Repo/tree/main/scripts)
Two scrips I made to make life easier for me. The first is a script to start the server, the second is a script to make a backup of the worlds and place it in a directory. NOTE: If you use said script you will need to edit this script because it will not pertain exactly to your filesystem. Also, these are bash scripts. They are not compatible with Windows Powershell though there might be some conversion tool, not sure.

## [Spigot Jars](https://github.com/Patrickk17/Mine-Crack-Archive-Repo/tree/main/spigot-jars)
Contains the spigot (and mojang) .jar server files present on the Mine-Crack server.

## [World Saves](https://github.com/Patrickk17/Mine-Crack-Archive-Repo/tree/main/world-saves)
Contains all the server backups since April. Backups were typically done every other sunday. 

## License

The vast majority of this is not my actual work. In fact I believe it's only the scrips and the discord bot (licensed under a different license). For the works which are mine, they are licensed under the GPL 3.0 License.
